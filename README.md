#Arduino Memory Game
The idea of ​​the game is to memorize the sequence of lights emitted by the LEDs.
Initially only one led flashes, then the player has to press the button associated with the flashing led.
From each new round the number of blinking LEDs increases by one.
The player who misses no sequence by the end of the **number of rounds** wins.
The number of game rounds is defined in code.
